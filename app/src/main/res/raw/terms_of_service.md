# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: February 20, 2026**

Welcome to **Wholesome Island** (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 1. Private, Local-First Architecture
Wholesome Island is a client interface for the Ollama framework. 
*   **User-Hosted Infrastructure:** You are responsible for hosting and maintaining your own Ollama server.
*   **Local Processing:** All AI reasoning, text generation, and image analysis occur on your own hardware via your Ollama instance. No chat data, system prompts, or images are ever transmitted to or stored by the developer of this App.

## 2. Acceptable Use & Prohibited Content
You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws.
*   **No Liability for Content:** The developer of Wholesome Island does not control the output generated by the AI models you choose to run. We are not liable for any inappropriate, illegal, harmful, or offensive content generated by your local models.
*   **Prohibited Uses:** You may not use the App to facilitate, promote, or engage in illegal activities, including but not limited to harassment, fraud, or the distribution of child exploitative material.

## 3. Demilitarized Use Clause
Wholesome Island is designed for peaceful, creative, and educational purposes. 
*   **No Weapons of War:** The App must not be used in the design, development, production, or execution of any weapon of war, military operation, or autonomous combat system.

## 4. Web Search Feature
If enabled, the App sends search queries directly to your chosen search provider (e.g., DuckDuckGo, custom APIs).
*   **Third-Party Privacy:** Your search activity is subject to the privacy policies of those providers.
*   **Custom Engines:** The App allows you to use your own API keys and self-hosted search instances (like SearXNG) for maximum privacy control.

## 5. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability
*   **"As-Is" Basis:** The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. 
*   **No Liability:** To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the App, including but not limited to data loss or hardware failure.

## 6. Voluntary Support
Any tips or donations made via "Buy Me a Coffee" are strictly voluntary and do not constitute a contract for guaranteed uptime or specific future features.

## 7. Changes to Terms
The developer reserves the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the App following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
